Learning Rails
==

Learning Rails with a tutorial from the RailsApps project. They didn't say to add this next bit, but the tutorial is great. It's by Daniel Kehoe and it's about $10 on Amazon.

Highly recommended, although if you're reading this you probably already know a lot about Rails and about the world.
